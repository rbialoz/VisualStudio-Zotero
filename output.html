            <div class="title">Quantifying natural disturbances using a large‐scale dendrochronological reconstruction to guide forest management</div>
            <div class="abstract">AbstractEstimates of historical disturbance patterns are essential to guide forest management aimed at ensuring the sustainability of ecosystem functions and biodiversity. However, quantitative estimates of various disturbance characteristics required in management applications are rare in longer‐term historical studies. Thus, our objectives were to (1) quantify past disturbance severity, patch size, and stand proportion disturbed and (2) test for temporal and subregional differences in these characteristics. We developed a comprehensive dendrochronological method to evaluate an approximately two‐century‐long disturbance record in the remaining Central and Eastern European primary mountain spruce forests, where wind and bark beetles are the predominant disturbance agents. We used an unprecedented large‐scale nested design data set of 541 plots located within 44 stands and 6 subregions. To quantify individual disturbance events, we used tree‐ring proxies, which were aggregated at plot and stand levels by smoothing and detecting peaks in their distributions. The spatial aggregation of disturbance events was used to estimate patch sizes. Data exhibited continuous gradients from low‐ to high‐severity and small‐ to large‐size disturbance events. In addition to the importance of small disturbance events, moderate‐scale (25–75% of the stand disturbed, &gt;10 ha patch size) and moderate‐severity (25–75% of canopy disturbed) events were also common. Moderate disturbances represented more than 50% of the total disturbed area and their rotation periods ranged from one to several hundred years, which is within the lifespan of local tree species. Disturbance severities differed among subregions, whereas the stand proportion disturbed varied significantly over time. This indicates partially independent variations among disturbance characteristics. Our quantitative estimates of disturbance severity, patch size, stand proportion disturbed, and associated rotation periods provide rigorous baseline data for future ecological research, decisions within biodiversity conservation, and silviculture intended to maintain native biodiversity and ecosystem functions. These results highlight a need for sufficiently large and adequately connected networks of strict reserves, more complex silvicultural treatments that emulate the natural disturbance spectrum in harvest rotation times, sizes, and intensities, and higher levels of tree and structural legacy retention.</div>

            <div class="title">Winter storm risk assessment in forests with high resolution gust speed data</div>
            <div class="abstract">Winter storms pose a major threat to forest management in Central Europe. They affect forests at a large spatial scale and produce large losses in standing and merchantable timber within few hours. The assessment of winter storm vulnerability by statistical modelling serves as an important tool to tackle uncertainities about the damage risk and to inform management decision processes. This study made use of an extensive forest inventory data set from South-West Germany before and after winter storm Lothar in 1999, one of the most severe storm events in Germany over the last decades. Hierarchical logistic models were fitted to relate storm damage probability on individual tree level to features of dendrometry, site, orography, and storm-specific high resolution data of maximum gust speed. We developed two different approaches to implement gust speed as a predictor and compared them to a baseline model with a structured spatial effect function with no gust speed information. Regional and local variability which could not be described by the predictors was modelled by multi-level group effects. Generalisation performance was tested with a spatially and temporally independent data set on storm separation between explicit spatial gust speeds and unknown variability achieved with the parametric multi-level approach led to a higher degree of transparency and utilisability.</div>

            <div class="abstract">Effects of forest management on forest biodiversity have received increasing attention in both research and forestry practice. Despite advances in technology, monitoring of biodiversity remains time and cost-intensive and requires specific taxonomic expertise. In forest management, however, there is increasing interest and need to integrate biodiversity monitoring into forest inventories efficiently to estimate the potential effects of forest management on biodiversity. Forest management systems can differ greatly depending on management goals and the intensity and frequency of the applied silvicultural interventions. To identify management effects on biodiversity, an estimation of biodiversity using forest structural attributes may be a reasonable approach. Forest structure can – compared to conventional species-based monitoring - easily be captured during forest inventories and does not require specific taxonomic expertise. The IBP (Index of Biodiversity Potential) is a composite index aiming to provide practitioners with an efficient tool for estimating biodiversity at the local level. We recorded the IBP on 147 plots in three regions of Germany, where detailed biodiversity monitoring had been conducted. This study quantified the relationship between changes in the IBP scores and changes in species richness for 13 taxonomic groups. To determine this, we analyzed estimated relationships between the IBP and species richness using a count regression model. We found positive estimated relationships with species richness of birds, fungi, true bugs, lichens, and moths in at least 3 of 5 examined forest types. However, for spiders, bats, carabids, necrophagous and saproxylic beetles, either no relationship with the IBP or estimated relationships with only one forest type were found. Changes in scores for the IBP’s factors number of vertical layers, large living trees, treerelated microhabitats, and proportion of gaps correlated with changes in the measured species richness in many cases. Even though the IBP is generally not adequate to predict actual presence or precise number of species, it can be utilized to depict a forest stand’s potential in terms of species richness.

            <div class="title">What does literature tell us about the relationship between forest structural attributes and species richness in temperate forests? – A review</div>
            <div class="abstract">The effects of forest management on species richness and diversity have become important research interests. The need to maintain biodiversity for forest ecosystem functioning has led to the question of how strongly and in what ways forest management modifies the diversity and abundance of different species groups. It is well known that many forest species rely on specific structures that may be modified by forest management. Assessing the impact of forest management on species richness may therefore require identification of structural properties. For this literature review we identified a large set of structural attributes that can serve as potential drivers of the richness of different species groups. Most studies included here focused on only one or a few structural attributes as explanatory variables and a limited number of species groups as dependent variables; we therefore analyzed the available publications across species and structural properties. We gathered 410 relationships of structure and species richness out of 85 studies from the temperate region in Europe. Positive, negative, and neutral (nonexistent) correlations between species richness and the presence of specific structural properties in European temperate forests were then compiled. Canopy gaps and structural attributes related to old-growth successional stage such as stand age and the share of large old trees were mostly positively correlated with species richness of the different taxa. Especially old-growth structures were ranked high in the reviewed literature. The structural attributes that were mainly positively correlated with species richness or the richness of groups of species may be used for further development of biodiversity monitoring concepts and forest management.</div>

            <div class="title">Debarking harvesters simultaneously combat the European spruce bark beetle (&lt;i&gt;Ips typographus&lt;/i&gt;) and conserve non‐target beetle diversity</div>
            <div class="abstract">AbstractIn the face of climate change, the European Spruce Bark Beetle (Ips typographus) breeding predominantly in Norway spruce (Picea abies) led to exceptional amounts of damaged timber in European forests. Up to now, if pest control is applied, damaged or weakened P. abies trees are either extracted by salvage logging or, when quantities are low, made unsuitable for breeding by manual debarking techniques. Both pest control interventions are costly, are often limited by the short timeframe of effectiveness and come with negative impacts on the non‐target biodiversity.As alternatives for timely removal, a debarking head for harvesters for large scale disturbances and a bark gouging device for motor‐manual treatment have been developed in recent years to make breeding material unsuitable for bark beetles and reduce existing larvae.Based on data from an experimental design with infested Norway spruce logs, we show that the harvester debarking head and the motor‐manual bark gouging regulate I. typographus populations efficiently, whereas a conventional harvester did not reduce the emerging bark beetles. Species assemblages of non‐target beetles living in the infested Norway spruce logs were altered from the natural species assemblages in control logs by processing logs with the debarking head or the bark gouging device but not by the conventional harvester. None of the bark treatments reduced non‐target beetle species richness in this experiment.Practical implication. We endorse the debarking head and bark gouging as alternatives to salvage logging and manual debarking. This uncouples pest control from in‐time dependencies on the availability of transport capacities. The debarking head and bark gouging open up the opportunity to retain dead wood biomass in the forest, supporting ecological benefits and conservation goals. Particularly for protected areas these two new management options better balance requirements of pest control and biodiversity conservation.</div>

            <div class="title">Modeling European beech defoliation at a regional scale gradient in Germany from northern lowlands to central uplands using geo-ecological parameters, Sentinel-2 and National Forest Condition Survey data</div>
            <div class="abstract">Since 2018, severe droughts have affected a significant part of central Europe, causing premature leaf senescence in European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). The correlation between the vitality of Fagus sylvatica L. and various geoecological and biological determinants (such as elevation, slope, aspect, tree age, and soil properties) concerning hydrological drought stress is still not well understood, especially when integrating multiple geographical datasets. In addition, the determination of crown condition by remote sensing and geo-ecological parameters is still under development; it would allow the assessment of an area-wide forest health status. Our analysis incorporated annual field data from the German National Forest Condition Survey (Waldzustandserhebung, WZE) as a response variable and employed geo-ecological parameters derived from a digital elevation model, soil properties and vegetation indices from a Sentinel-2 time series to explain and predict the crown defoliation of European beech throughout the drought-impacted period spanning 2016–2022 across the federal states Schleswig-Holstein, Lower Saxony, and Hesse of Germany. In a second step, the results of the modeling were used for mapping of crown defoliation in Hesse, Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein. By employing Gradient Boosting Machines and Random Forest for regression analysis, the study uncovered the relationships between crown defoliation and the used predictors. Training was conducted on 80 % of the dataset, with the remaining 20 % serving as a test set for model validation. Regression findings based on static explanatory variable sets were improved by dynamic explanatory variables such as estimates of soil moisture, vegetation index metrics, and diameter at breast height. Furthermore, we identified key predictors for mapping crown defoliation of Fagus sylvatica L. and recommended using vegetation indices as additional predictors for future studies. The modeling results provided comparably accurate estimates compared to WZE estimates (R2 of 0.794 and RMSE of 7.646 %) during testing. Topographic and static soil predictors were significant, with soil moisture being a particularly influential variable for model optimization. Based on the predicted crown defoliation, beech trees with low to moderate crown defoliation predominated in beech distribution areas across the examined federal states, while a small number of beech trees with high defoliation were identified mostly in South Lower Saxony and Hesse. The annual variations in the proportions of beech trees showing increasing and decreasing crown defoliation indicate that the condition of the crown temporarily deteriorated when soil moisture decreased, but beech trees recovered after prolonged periods of drought. Additionally, beech trees in the study region exposed to declining soil moisture may suffer from medium-term declines in vitality. The predicted crown defoliation data can be utilized for future climate-adaptive management practices in European beech forests.</div>
